    <p>HVACPlaybook was developed with the end user in mind. The goal is to automate the process of proposal data entry with an online tool that's intuitive and integrates with other systems. HVACPlaybook features a Proposal Wizard that assists with the automatic capture of proposal data with dynamic screens designed to prompt the user with data based on prior system selections. This robust proposal wizard then feeds all proposals to a robust grid for easy retrieval and printing of proposal data in an easy-to-understand format for the customer.</p>
